## General info
This assignment had me refactor existing code. You needed to analyze the document to see its structure and make the css and html more semantic in nature. I decided to follow two rules detailed below. I used a naming convention that also allows you to take advantage of pressing the tab button to view avaible options since you go from general to specific. And an html web design that followed the recipe below.

## Diagram
Semantic Naming Convention: General --> Specific | Contrainer, Elements, Details <br/>
Tree Branching Convention: Start with a section html tag. If there's another tag that leads to another tag in the section html tag, classify it as a section. If not, use semantic html tag other than section. 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS

## Setup
I initially tried to create a remote repository on github, but did not succeed. I will ask someone tomorrow for help in class. So I created a repository on github and cloned it to my computer through the terminal. 

## Features
* Directory Structure Class Naming - This follows the General --> Specific principle. 
* Object Document Model - This follows HTML Tree Branching principle. 

To-do list:
* Drop the 2nd level class names for this particular document. 

## Status
Project is:  _finished_
