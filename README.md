## General info
This assignment had me refactor existing code. You needed to analyze the document to see its structure and make the css and html more semantic in nature. I decided to follow two rules detailed below. A simplified naming convention that also allows you to take advantage of pressing the tab button to view avaible options since you go from general to specific. And an html web design that followed this recipe below. Although it works when you follow the diagram for Tree Branching, if you do not classify the entire branch as a section, following my rules, the code would not compile properly to produce the website template. 

## Diagram
Semantic Naming Convention: General --> Specific | Contrainer, Elements, Details
Tree Branching Convention: Start with a container. If there's an element that leads to another element, classify it as a container 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS

## Setup
I initially tried to create a remote repository on github, but did not succeed. So I created a repository on github and cloned it to my computer through the terminal. 

## Features
* Directory Structure Class Naming - This follows the General --> Specific principle. 
* Object Document Model - This follows HTML Tree Branching principle. 

To-do list:
* Drop the 2nd level class names for this particular document. 

## Status
Project is:  _finished_
